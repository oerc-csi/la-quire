This collection was largely established by one man, Sir Arthur Evans, and is focused on the archaeological site with which he is closely associated: Knossos. Visitors to the Museum can see the highlights of this collection in the Aegean World gallery. Museum staff are also working to make these objects and their associated archive accessible online, so they can be viewed from anywhere in the world.

The Ashmolean Museum opened to the public in 1683 – the first museum of its kind in Britain – but it was Evans who oversaw the collection’s move to its present location. The grand neoclassical building on Beaumont Street in the centre of Oxford, designed by Charles Robert Cockerell, was originally the University Art Galleries. In 1894 the collections were merged to become the Ashmolean Museum of Art and Archaeology. This project took up much of the first ten years of Sir Arthur Evans’s time as Keeper; it was only after this work was completed that he made his first visit to Crete.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fnref2\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">2</a></sup></p>\n<p>One of Evans’s aims in visiting Crete was to build up the Ashmolean collection. He had been brought up with coins and antiquities from an early age since his father, Sir John Evans, was a gentleman scholar who had made important discoveries of prehistoric stone tools and served as President of the Society of Antiquaries. The family paper business provided the wealth to allow both father and son to accumulate personal collections of antiquities, and later to finance the excavations and restorations at Knossos. After a collecting trip to Athens in 1893, Arthur Evans became interested in seal stones bearing what looked like a prehistoric script. These, he established, originated in Crete, and so he became determined to visit.  His later excavations at Knossos uncovered further evidence of this script, as well as the clay sealings that preserved impressions of similar seal stones used for recording transactions.</p>\n<p>Between 1894 and 1899 Evans travelled around Crete, at times witnessing the aftermath of violence between the Christian and Muslim populations of the island. A former journalist, he often sent reports to British newspapers and periodicals, both on contemporary Crete and its archaeological remains.  During this time he collected a large number of antiquities: at each village he visited he would ask if there were ‘antikes’ for sale. The first objects from Knossos in the Ashmolean’s collection were acquired in this way.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fnref3\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">3</a></sup></p>\n<p>Evans’s collecting activities were well known to the local authorities on Crete, and he does not record any attempts to prevent him from purchasing or exporting antiquities at this time. He was able to take advantage of the unstable political situation in Crete, which had gained autonomy but not independence from the Ottoman Empire. Local officials generally welcomed foreign archaeologists, particularly those like Evans who were willing to denounce the Ottoman Empire in the British press. Ottoman laws governing the export of antiquities were, seemingly, not observed. In common with many nineteenth-century scholars, Evans regarded small, portable antiquities (such as coins and seal stones) as beyond the scope of antiquities legislation, and so felt entitled to collect them in any case.  Local officials were more focused on preventing new excavations, in case major antiquities such as sculptures were dug up and packed off to Constantinople Museum.</p>\n<p>New antiquities laws came into force in 1899, passed by the government of the newly independent Cretan State. These allowed Evans to excavate at Knossos but not to export any of his finds until a change in the law in 1903. Most of the Ashmolean’s objects from Knossos were exported during the short period before Crete was unified with Greece in 1913 and excavators could request ‘useless’ objects for their collections.  A few other significant objects from Knossos were donated to the Ashmolean by the Government of Greece in 1923 in recognition of Evans’s contribution to  archaeological research, such as the <a href=\"/catalogue/4/\">bull-leaper fresco</a>.</p>\n<p>There were many important or unique objects excavated at Knossos that Evans was not able to export from Crete: these went instead to Heraklion Archaeological Museum. Instead he commissioned replicas of these which could be displayed in the Ashmolean. The plaster cast of the Throne of Minos and replica of the Priest King on display in the gallery are two examples, as well as replicas of smaller items such as the faience <a href=\"/catalogue/5/\">‘snake goddesses’</a> found in the Temple Repositories in 1903. Other replicas appear in the portrait of Sir Arthur Evans that was commissioned in 1907, shortly before he stepped down as Keeper. Although it shows him among the ruins of Knossos, it was painted in London, with the replicas providing the artist, Sir William Richmond, with models for some of the finds.</p>\n<p>The Ashmolean was also bequeathed Arthur Evans’s archaeological archive which includes the original excavation records for Knossos. It contains over 50 notebooks kept by Evans and other members of his team, hundreds of drawings of architecture and finds, and thousands of photos. Some of the drawings of frescoes were made by Émile Gilliéron, father and son, as they tried to reconstruct the colourful fragments into complete designs. Evans drew upon all of these as he wrote up his excavations at Knossos in the massive four-volume work, The Palace of Minos, published between 1921 and 1935.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fnref4\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">4</a></sup>  The archive also includes early drafts and proofs of this book, and other publications by Evans. But the photos also provide a glimpse of life during excavation, including the many Cretan workers employed to work at Knossos and the excavators themselves posing for the camera.</p>\n<p>Fragile archive items cannot be put on long-term display in the permanent gallery for reasons of conservation, but many of the objects in the collection are already available on the Ashmolean’s website, and as database records are checked, more are being added all the time.</p>\n<p>To explore all of the objects in the Aegean World Gallery see <a href=\"https://www.ashmolean.org/collections-online#/search/simple-search/%22Aegean%20World%22/%7B%7D/1/16/_score/desc/catalogue\" target=\"_blank\">Ashmolean Collections Online</a>.</p>\n<figure id=\"knossos-workers\" class=\"q-figure q-figure--image\"> <a class=\"q-figure__modal-link\" href=\"#knossos-workers\" data-outputs-include=\"html\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"q-figure__image\" src=\"/_assets/images/figures/knossos-workers.jpg\"> </a> <figcaption class=\"q-figure__caption\" data-outputs-include=\"html\"> <span class=\"q-figure__caption-content\">Photograph of Theodore Fyfe and Cretan workmen at Knossos, 1901</span> <span class=\"q-figure__credit\">Ashmolean Museum, University of Oxford</span> </figcaption> <img alt=\"\" class=\"q-figure__image\" src=\"/_assets/images/figures/knossos-workers.jpg\" data-outputs-include=\"epub,pdf\"> <figcaption class=\"q-figure__caption\" data-outputs-include=\"epub,pdf\"> <span class=\"q-figure__caption-content\">Photograph of Theodore Fyfe and Cretan workmen at Knossos, 1901</span> <span class=\"q-figure__credit\">Ashmolean Museum, University of Oxford</span> </figcaption> </figure>\n<div class=\"backmatter\">\n<h2>Notes</h2>\n</div>\n<section class=\"footnotes\">\n<ol class=\"footnotes-list\">\n<li id=\"fn1\" class=\"footnote-item\"><p><cite class=\"quire-citation expandable\"><span class=\"quire-citation__button\" role=\"button\" tabindex=\"0\" aria-expanded=\"false\">Galanakis 2013</span><span class=\"quire-citation__content\" hidden>Galanakis, Yannis ed., <em>The Aegean World: A Guide to the Cycladic, Minoan and Mycenaean Antiquities in the Ashmolean Museum</em>, Oxford and Athens, 2013</span></cite> <a href=\"#fnref1\" class=\"footnote-backref\">↩︎</a></p>\n</li>\n<li id=\"fn2\" class=\"footnote-item\"><p>see <cite class=\"quire-citation expandable\"><span class=\"quire-citation__button\" role=\"button\" tabindex=\"0\" aria-expanded=\"false\">MacGillivray 2000</span><span class=\"quire-citation__content\" hidden>MacGillivray, J.

The Labyrinth was an ingenious maze commissioned by King Minos and designed by the architect Daedalus. In order to escape it after killing the Minotaur, Theseus needed a ball of thread, given to him by the princess Ariadne. Or at least that is the most commonly accepted story – digging deeper into the myth shows that reveals a multitude of contradictory versions. Myths are continually reworked and retold, and that of the Labyrinth is no exception.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fnref1\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">1</a></sup></p>\n<p>Knossos, on the island of Crete, is mentioned in the earliest work of Greek literature, Homer’s Iliad, which was composed some time before 700 BCE. Intriguingly Homer tells us that Daedalus built a dancing floor for Ariadne at Knossos, but doesn’t mention the Labyrinth. Herodotus, the earliest Greek historian, describes an impressive building called a Labyrinth, but locates it in Egypt, at a city called Crocodilopolis. Only later did authors locate the Labyrinth at Knossos. Writing several hundred years later, the Roman historian Pliny the Elder lists a number of different Labyrinths, suggesting that the Egyptian building had inspired Daedalus to build the one in Crete. But of this Cretan Labyrinth, Pliny says, nothing remained.</p>\n<p>At the same time as these different accounts of the Labyrinth were being written down, artists were producing a variety of depictions of the myth. Greek vases frequently show <a href=\"/catalogue/2/\">Theseus killing the Minotaur with a sword</a>. The <a href=\"/catalogue/1/\">coins of Knossos</a> were decorated with a symbol of the city: a Labyrinth design which sometimes had a Minotaur at the centre. This design, unlike most literary descriptions, has a single path into the centre. It appears more like a bird’s eye view of a building, and one in which it is impossible to get lost.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://pleiades.stoa.org/places/589872\" target=\"_blank\">Knossos</a> was an important Cretan city in the Greek and Roman period. When the Roman conquest of Crete began in 69 BCE, its citizens resisted. As a result the rival city of <a href=\"https://pleiades.stoa.org/places/589796\" target=\"_blank\">Gortyn</a>, 60 km south of Knossos, became the Roman provincial capital. New civic buildings were required, and the stone for these was quarried out of a nearby hillside. This left a network of underground passages going deep underground. From this period onwards, authors start to confuse Knossos and Gortyn, and the location of the Labyrinth started to shift: the Roman poet, Catullus for instance, refers to the home of King Minos as ‘Gortynian’. A later Byzantine author, Ioannes Malalas, described the Labyrinth as a cave near Gortyn.</p>\n<h2>Looking for the Labyrinth</h2>\n<p>The Renaissance renewed interest in Greece and its myths, resulting in a search for the real Labyrinth. The Florentine priest, Cristoforo Buondelmonti, first visited Crete in 1415 and explored both Knossos and Gortyn. By this time there was little to see at Knossos – it had been abandoned following an earthquake in the 8th century CE – and certainly nothing that resembled the Labyrinth. Buondelmonti described the underground passages near Gortyn, and although he recognised it as a quarry, <a href=\"https://digital.bodleian.ox.ac.uk/objects/ef292757-e16f-4818-ae90-f2cbbf9dc5b6/surfaces/5db6a6bd-6c61-4fe7-ba9e-8ca66c344009/\" target=\"_blank\">his map of the island</a> shows the Labyrinth as a cave in the middle of the island.</p>\n<p>The debate over the location of the true Labyrinth continued for several hundred years. In the 19th century Captain Thomas Spratt visited the caves at Gortyn while surveying Crete for a new map of the island for the British Admiralty. He described them as “unquestionably a real labyrinth, such as the ancients understood by that term” and wondered if King Minos had kept Athenians prisoners there.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fnref2\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">2</a></sup> Robert Pashley meanwhile regarded the Labyrinth as “a work of the imagination” but kept faith with Knossos, despite the fact that it had “dwindled down into this miserable hamlet”.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fnref3\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">3</a></sup> The location of Knossos had never been forgotten since coins of the city continued to be found there. The problem was that there was nothing to see there for those going in search of the Labyrinth.</p>\n<p>The argument was finally resolved in 1878 by a local businessman named, appropriately enough, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minos_Kalokairinos\" target=\"_blank\">Minos Kalokairinos</a>. He had been inspired to dig at Knossos by the excavations of Heinrich Schliemann at Troy and Mycenae. There Schliemann had found archaeological treasures which seemed to link these places with their mythical past. Digging on an area to the south of the Greek and Roman city, on the bare Kephala hill, Kalokairinos soon found the remains of a building with curious symbols carved on the walls. Given its apparent age, he regarded this as the palace of King Minos, but located the Labyrinth in a nearby cave at Ayia Irini. This too was an ancient quarry, and shows Kalokairinos’s faith in the later literary traditions.</p>\n<p>Kalokairinos’s discovery rapidly attracted the attention of foreign archaeologists. They agreed that the building looked ancient but went a step further than Kalokairinos and identified it with the Labyrinth. William Stillman sent a report to the Archaeological Institute of America describing the building with its complicated corridors as the “Daedalian Labyrinth”.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fnref4\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">4</a></sup> Kalokairinos had been forced to stop his excavations by the Cretan authorities because at that time Crete was part of the Ottoman Empire and it was feared that his finds would be removed to the museum at Constantinople.</p>\n<h2>Excavating the Labyrinth</h2>\n<p>When Arthur Evans visited Knossos in March 1894, he was shown round the excavations by Kalokairinos and wrote in his diary “I see no reason for not thinking that the mysterious complication of passages is the Labyrinth”.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fnref5\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">5</a></sup> He was fascinated by the symbols carved on the walls, including a sign in the shape of a double axe. By purchasing a part of the land and waiting until Cretan Independence, Evans was able to establish the rights to excavate.</p>\n<figure id=\"knossos-plan\" class=\"q-figure q-figure--image is-pulled-right\"> <a class=\"q-figure__modal-link\" href=\"#knossos-plan\" data-outputs-include=\"html\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"q-figure__image\" src=\"/iiif/knossos-plan/knossos-plan/static-inline-figure-image.jpg\"> </a> <figcaption class=\"q-figure__caption\" data-outputs-include=\"html\"> <span class=\"q-figure__caption-content\">Plan of Knossos, 1928</span> <span class=\"q-figure__credit\">. © Ashmolean Museum, University of Oxford</span> </figcaption> <img alt=\"\" class=\"q-figure__image\" src=\"/iiif/knossos-plan/knossos-plan/print-image.jpg\" data-outputs-include=\"epub,pdf\"> <figcaption class=\"q-figure__caption\" data-outputs-include=\"epub,pdf\"> <span class=\"q-figure__caption-content\">Plan of Knossos, 1928</span> <span class=\"q-figure__credit\">. © Ashmolean Museum, University of Oxford</span> </figcaption> </figure>\n<p>Evans uncovered the rest of the labyrinthine building he called ‘the Palace of Minos’ between 1900 and 1904. A number of discoveries convinced him that this was indeed the Labyrinth including <a href=\"/catalogue/4/\">frescoes of people leaping over bulls</a> which echoed the myth of the Minotaur. He found further carvings of double axes and suggested that since an ancient name for this symbol was ‘labrys’, Labyrinth should mean ‘House of the Double Axes’. In other words the Palace and the Labyrinth were one and the same.</p>\n<h2>Rebuilding the Labyrinth</h2>\n<p>Almost immediately, Evans set about restoring, and then rebuilding, this Bronze Age building, now thought to have existed from 2000–1350 BC. Some of the later ‘reconstitutions’ as he called them, used reinforced concrete to promote his theories. The reconstructed bull fresco at the North Entrance, he suggested, had continued to stand even after the Palace had been destroyed, inspiring the myth of the Minotaur and the Labyrinth.</p>\n<figure id=\"vid-3d-palace\" class=\"q-figure q-figure--youtube\"> <div class=\"q-figure__media-wrapper q-figure__media-wrapper--widescreen\" data-outputs-include=\"html\"> <iframe allow=\"accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen=\"\" class=\"q-figure-video-element q-figure-video-element--embed\" frameborder=\"0\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/OTIJPPf2wuE\"></iframe> </div> <figcaption class=\"q-figure__caption\" data-outputs-include=\"html\"> <span class=\"q-figure__label q-figure__label--below\"> <a class=\"q-figure__modal-link\" href=\"#vid-3d-palace\"><span class=\"q-figure__label-icon\"><svg data-outputs-exclude=\"epub,pdf\">   <switch>     <use xlink:href=\"#fullscreen-icon\"></use>   </switch> </svg> <span class=\"visually-hidden\" data-outputs-exclude=\"epub,pdf\">Expand</span> </span><span class=\"q-figure__label-text\">3d model of Knossos</span></a> </span> <span class=\"q-figure__caption-content\">Made by the School of Archaeology, University of Oxford</span> <span class=\"q-figure__credit\">University of Oxford</span> </figcaption> <div class=\"q-figure__media-wrapper--widescreen\" data-outputs-include=\"epub,pdf\"> <img src=\"/_assets/images/figures/3d-model.png\"> </div> <figcaption class=\"q-figure__caption\" data-outputs-include=\"epub,pdf\"> <span class=\"q-figure__caption-embed-link\"><a href=\"https://youtu.be/OTIJPPf2wuE\"><em>https://youtu.be/OTIJPPf2wuE</em></a></span> <span class=\"q-figure__label q-figure__label--below\"> <a class=\"q-figure__modal-link\" href=\"#vid-3d-palace\"><span class=\"q-figure__label-icon\"><svg data-outputs-exclude=\"epub,pdf\">   <switch>     <use xlink:href=\"#fullscreen-icon\"></use>   </switch> </svg> <span class=\"visually-hidden\" data-outputs-exclude=\"epub,pdf\">Expand</span> </span><span class=\"q-figure__label-text\">3d model of Knossos</span></a> </span> <span class=\"q-figure__caption-content\">Made by the School of Archaeology, University of Oxford</span> <span class=\"q-figure__credit\">University of Oxford</span> </figcaption> </figure>\n<p>Among those inspired by Evans’s reconstructions have been the designers of the game Assassin’s Creed: Odyssey.

He employed a team of archaeologists, local workers, architects and artists, and together they built up a picture of the community that had occupied the elaborate building 4000 years ago. The Palace of Minos, as he called it, had evidently gone through periods of wealth, destruction, rebuilding, and eventual abandonment.</p>\n<p>It is now difficult to disentangle Evans’s vision of the palace from the reality. Soon after excavation began in 1900, a room with a stone seat came to light. Evans regarded this as the throne of King Minos (although he originally wondered if it was meant for princess Ariadne).

It was a place for gatherings and celebrations. Wine, meat and olive oil were produced in the surrounding area and brought to the centre for consumption. Evans and his team imagined a sophisticated, nature-loving people, whose civilisation peaked, and then went into decline. Evans suggested that the finest pottery was used by a royal family, but there is no clear evidence that one existed.</p>\n<p>The finest pottery was known as <a href=\"/catalogue/7/\">‘Kamares Ware’</a> since the first examples were discovered in nearby Kamares Cave. It was produced in the centuries after the palace was first built, around 2000-1700 BCE. The black shiny finish and thin walls seem to imitate silver, which goes black over time. Later on pottery designs were painted directly on to the surface of the clay. Some of these designs were abstract but others show <a href=\"/catalogue/8/\">plants</a> or marine animals.</p>\n<h2>The Status of Women</h2>\n<p>Women appear prominently on frescoes and <a href=\"/catalogue/5/\">other objects</a> from the Palace. They often wear elaborate dyed textiles indicating wealth. Weaving and dyeing were important activities at Knossos because these textiles were traded beyond the island of Crete in return for raw materials like metals. It is possible that these high-status women were important players in the manufacture and trade in textiles. Some archaeologists have even suggested that Minoan Crete was a matriarchy, with women in power. Evans, however, believed that women’s importance in Minoan society was religious, as priestesses of a mother goddess.</p>\n<figure id=\"ladies-in-blue\" class=\"q-figure q-figure--image\"> <a class=\"q-figure__modal-link\" href=\"#ladies-in-blue\" data-outputs-include=\"html\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"q-figure__image\" src=\"/iiif/ladies-in-blue/ladies-in-blue/static-inline-figure-image.jpg\"> </a> <figcaption class=\"q-figure__caption\" data-outputs-include=\"html\"> <span class=\"q-figure__caption-content\">Émile Gilliéron père (1850–1924), Restoration of Ladies in Blue Fresco, undated, watercolour, 95 × 161 cm, AJE/4/1/12/1/3</span> <span class=\"q-figure__credit\">. © Ashmolean Museum, University of Oxford</span> </figcaption> <img alt=\"\" class=\"q-figure__image\" src=\"/iiif/ladies-in-blue/ladies-in-blue/print-image.jpg\" data-outputs-include=\"epub,pdf\"> <figcaption class=\"q-figure__caption\" data-outputs-include=\"epub,pdf\"> <span class=\"q-figure__caption-content\">Émile Gilliéron père (1850–1924), Restoration of Ladies in Blue Fresco, undated, watercolour, 95 × 161 cm, AJE/4/1/12/1/3</span> <span class=\"q-figure__credit\">. © Ashmolean Museum, University of Oxford</span> </figcaption> </figure>\n<p>The Linear B tablets from Knossos were preserved by fire when the palace was burnt down in around 1350 BCE. They record an extensive textile industry in which men were <a href=\"/catalogue/9/\">shepherds</a> and women were <a href=\"/catalogue/10/\">textile workers</a>. By this time there was a king, ‘wanax’ in charge of the palace but it is not clear how far back this position goes because there are no historical records preserved. When Linear B was deciphered by Michael Ventris in 1952 it became apparent that all of the tablets deal with the economy of the palace.</p>\n<h2>The Bulls of Crete</h2>\n<p>Bulls crop up in several of the myths set in Crete and cattle were closely associated with the Palace of Minos. They appear on frescoes and <a href=\"/catalogue/3/\">seal-stones</a>, and there were vessels in the shape of their <a href=\"/catalogue/12/\">heads</a>. Sometimes they are shown with <a href=\"/catalogue/6/\">people leaping over their backs</a>. This appears to have been part of an event like a rodeo, involving the cattle owned by the Palace. Some people have suggested that this took place in the Central Court. Evans proposed that bull-leaping inspired the myth of <a href=\"catalogue/2/\">Theseus and the Minotaur</a> because the images were still visible even after the Palace was destroyed.</p>\n<figure id=\"taureador\" class=\"q-figure q-figure--image\"> <a class=\"q-figure__modal-link\" href=\"#taureador\" data-outputs-include=\"html\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"q-figure__image\" src=\"/iiif/taureador/taureador/static-inline-figure-image.jpg\"> </a> <figcaption class=\"q-figure__caption\" data-outputs-include=\"html\"> <span class=\"q-figure__caption-content\">Emile Gilliéron père (1850–1924), Restoration of Taureador Fresco</span> <span class=\"q-figure__credit\">. © Ashmolean Museum, University of Oxford</span> </figcaption> <img alt=\"\" class=\"q-figure__image\" src=\"/iiif/taureador/taureador/print-image.jpg\" data-outputs-include=\"epub,pdf\"> <figcaption class=\"q-figure__caption\" data-outputs-include=\"epub,pdf\"> <span class=\"q-figure__caption-content\">Emile Gilliéron père (1850–1924), Restoration of Taureador Fresco</span> <span class=\"q-figure__credit\">. © Ashmolean Museum, University of Oxford</span> </figcaption> </figure>\n<h2>Octopuses</h2>\n<p>Some animal images from Knossos are astoundingly lifelike and detailed.</p>\n<figure id=\"ambushed-octopus\" class=\"q-figure q-figure--image is-pulled-right\"> <a class=\"q-figure__modal-link\" href=\"#ambushed-octopus\" data-outputs-include=\"html\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"q-figure__image\" src=\"/iiif/ambushed-octopus/ambushed-octopus/static-inline-figure-image.jpg\"> </a> <figcaption class=\"q-figure__caption\" data-outputs-include=\"html\"> <span class=\"q-figure__caption-content\">Reconstruction drawing of ‘Ambushed Octopus’ stone rhyton, undated, Ashmolean Museum  AJE/4/3/6/2/1</span> <span class=\"q-figure__credit\">. © Ashmolean Museum, University of Oxford</span> </figcaption> <img alt=\"\" class=\"q-figure__image\" src=\"/iiif/ambushed-octopus/ambushed-octopus/print-image.jpg\" data-outputs-include=\"epub,pdf\"> <figcaption class=\"q-figure__caption\" data-outputs-include=\"epub,pdf\"> <span class=\"q-figure__caption-content\">Reconstruction drawing of ‘Ambushed Octopus’ stone rhyton, undated, Ashmolean Museum  AJE/4/3/6/2/1</span> <span class=\"q-figure__credit\">. © Ashmolean Museum, University of Oxford</span> </figcaption> </figure>\n<p>Octopuses appear frequently – they almost become an emblem of the Palace. One of the most<br>\nunusual facts about them is that they are shown underwater, their eyes open – as if being watched underwater, as opposed to looked down on from above. Evans used depictions of marine animals to trace what he saw as the birth, maturity and decline of Minoan art. Although few would use these terms today it is noticeable<br>\nthat earlier objects are more naturalistic. In the later period of the Palace’s existence, the same designs – octopuses and bulls feature frequently – become increasingly stylised.</p>\n<p>One of the finest depictions of an octopus was carved in relief on a stone vessel known as the ‘Ambushed Octopus’. Designs like these were later transferred to pottery, particularly <a href=\"/catalogue/11/\">large jars</a> found in the storerooms of the palace.

The jar comes from the palace that Evans had excavated at Knossos and belongs to a culture he called Minoan, after the legendary King Minos.</p>\n<p>In the centuries after 1900 BC, Minoan civilization reached the height of its prosperity and influence and major palaces were built at Knossos and Mallia in the northern part of Crete, at Phaistos in the south, and at Zakros in the east. After 1500 BC, however, there was increasing influence from the Mycenaean culture of the Greek mainland and, around 1450 BC, widespread destruction on the island. Whether this was caused by invading Mycenaean warriors is unknown, but Greek influence on Crete certainly becomes even more pronounced.</p>\n<p>Pottery from the period following the destruction shows a blend of Minoan and Mycenaean stylistic traits. The shape of this jar is typically Mycenaean and, because the contents of such vessels – oil, wine and other commodities – were in much demand, examples have been found widely. An octopus had been a popular motif on Minoan pottery where animals were depicted with an extraordinary accuracy that came from a close observation of nature. The Mycenaean approach, however, was – as here – to take naturalistic motifs and abstract them, eventually to the point at which they are almost unrecognisable. The <a href=\"https://collections.ashmolean.org/object/478546\" target=\"_blank\">stirrup jar</a> below, also in the Aegean World gallery, shows how the octopus has become reduced to a wavy tentacle design.</p>\n<figure id=\"ae-584\" class=\"q-figure q-figure--image\"> <a class=\"q-figure__modal-link\" href=\"#ae_584\" data-outputs-include=\"html\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"q-figure__image\" src=\"/iiif/ae_584/ae_584/static-inline-figure-image.jpg\"> </a> <figcaption class=\"q-figure__caption\" data-outputs-include=\"html\"> <span class=\"q-figure__caption-content\">Stirrup jar decorated with painted tentacle pattern, 1300-1200 BCE, Ashmolean Museum  AN1896-1908.AE.584</span> <span class=\"q-figure__credit\">. © Ashmolean Museum, University of Oxford</span> </figcaption> <img alt=\"\" class=\"q-figure__image\" src=\"/iiif/ae_584/ae_584/print-image.jpg\" data-outputs-include=\"epub,pdf\"> <figcaption class=\"q-figure__caption\" data-outputs-include=\"epub,pdf\"> <span class=\"q-figure__caption-content\">Stirrup jar decorated with painted tentacle pattern, 1300-1200 BCE, Ashmolean Museum  AN1896-1908.AE.584</span> <span class=\"q-figure__credit\">. © Ashmolean Museum, University of Oxford</span> </figcaption> </figure>\n","length":347,"title":"Octopus Jar","type":"entry","url":"http://localhost:8080/catalogue/11/"},{"content":"<p>Rhyta are pouring vessels.
