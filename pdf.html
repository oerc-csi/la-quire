                  In 2023 the Ashmolean held an exhibition called
                  <em>Labyrinth: Knossos, Myth &amp; Reality</em>. This is a
                  resource for the Aegean World gallery based on the
                  exhibition’s content. It is an output of the AHRC-funded
                  project ‘Enriching Exhibition Stories: Adding Voices to
                  Quire’.

                  Although the vast majority of Minoan antiquities are visible
                  in Heraklion Archaeological Museum and the other museums on
                  the island of Crete itself, the Ashmolean Museum holds the
                  most comprehensive collection outside Greece. This collection
                  was largely established by one man, Sir Arthur Evans, and is
                  focused on the archaeological site with which he is closely
                  associated: Knossos. Visitors to the Museum can see the
                  highlights of this collection in the Aegean World gallery.
                  Museum staff are also working to make these objects and their
                  associated archive accessible online, so they can be viewed
                  from anywhere in the world. The Aegean World gallery was
                  opened in 2009 as part of a major refurbishment of the
                  Ashmolean Museum.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-intro-fn1" id="page-intro-fnref1" class="footnote-ref-anchor">1</a></sup>

                <p>
                  Although best remembered for his excavations at Knossos, Sir
                  Arthur Evans was also the Keeper of the Museum from 1884–1908.
                  The Ashmolean Museum opened to the public in 1683 – the first
                  museum of its kind in Britain – but it was Evans who oversaw
                  the collection’s move to its present location. The grand
                  neoclassical building on Beaumont Street in the centre of
                  Oxford, designed by Charles Robert Cockerell, was originally
                  the University Art Galleries. In 1894 the collections were
                  merged to become the Ashmolean Museum of Art and Archaeology.
                  This project took up much of the first ten years of Sir Arthur
                  Evans’s time as Keeper; it was only after this work was
                  completed that he made his first visit to Crete.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-intro-fn2" id="page-intro-fnref2" class="footnote-ref-anchor">2</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  One of Evans’s aims in visiting Crete was to build up the
                  Ashmolean collection. He had been brought up with coins and
                  antiquities from an early age since his father, Sir John
                  Evans, was a gentleman scholar who had made important
                  discoveries of prehistoric stone tools and served as President
                  of the Society of Antiquaries. The family paper business
                  provided the wealth to allow both father and son to accumulate
                  personal collections of antiquities, and later to finance the
                  excavations and restorations at Knossos. After a collecting
                  trip to Athens in 1893, Arthur Evans became interested in seal
                  stones bearing what looked like a prehistoric script. These,
                  he established, originated in Crete, and so he became
                  determined to visit. His later excavations at Knossos
                  uncovered further evidence of this script, as well as the clay
                  sealings that preserved impressions of similar seal stones
                  used for recording transactions.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Between 1894 and 1899 Evans travelled around Crete, at times
                  witnessing the aftermath of violence between the Christian and
                  Muslim populations of the island. A former journalist, he
                  often sent reports to British newspapers and periodicals, both
                  on contemporary Crete and its archaeological remains. During
                  this time he collected a large number of antiquities: at each
                  village he visited he would ask if there were ‘antikes’ for
                  sale. The first objects from Knossos in the Ashmolean’s
                  collection were acquired in this way.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-intro-fn3" id="page-intro-fnref3" class="footnote-ref-anchor">3</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  Evans’s collecting activities were well known to the local
                  authorities on Crete, and he does not record any attempts to
                  prevent him from purchasing or exporting antiquities at this
                  time. He was able to take advantage of the unstable political
                  situation in Crete, which had gained autonomy but not
                  independence from the Ottoman Empire. Local officials
                  generally welcomed foreign archaeologists, particularly those
                  like Evans who were willing to denounce the Ottoman Empire in
                  the British press. Ottoman laws governing the export of
                  antiquities were, seemingly, not observed. In common with many
                  nineteenth-century scholars, Evans regarded small, portable
                  antiquities (such as coins and seal stones) as beyond the
                  scope of antiquities legislation, and so felt entitled to
                  collect them in any case. Local officials were more focused on
                  preventing new excavations, in case major antiquities such as
                  sculptures were dug up and packed off to Constantinople
                  Museum.
                </p>
                <p>
                  New antiquities laws came into force in 1899, passed by the
                  government of the newly independent Cretan State. These
                  allowed Evans to excavate at Knossos but not to export any of
                  his finds until a change in the law in 1903. Most of the
                  Ashmolean’s objects from Knossos were exported during the
                  short period before Crete was unified with Greece in 1913 and
                  excavators could request ‘useless’ objects for their
                  collections. A few other significant objects from Knossos were
                  donated to the Ashmolean by the Government of Greece in 1923
                  in recognition of Evans’s contribution to archaeological
                  research, such as the
                  <a href="#page-la-quire-catalogue-4">bull-leaper fresco</a>.
                </p>
                <p>
                  There were many important or unique objects excavated at
                  Knossos that Evans was not able to export from Crete: these
                  went instead to Heraklion Archaeological Museum. Instead he
                  commissioned replicas of these which could be displayed in the
                  Ashmolean. The plaster cast of the Throne of Minos and replica
                  of the Priest King on display in the gallery are two examples,
                  as well as replicas of smaller items such as the faience
                  <a href="#page-la-quire-catalogue-5">‘snake goddesses’</a> found
                  in the Temple Repositories in 1903. Other replicas appear in
                  the portrait of Sir Arthur Evans that was commissioned in
                  1907, shortly before he stepped down as Keeper. Although it
                  shows him among the ruins of Knossos, it was painted in
                  London, with the replicas providing the artist, Sir William
                  Richmond, with models for some of the finds.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The Ashmolean was also bequeathed Arthur Evans’s
                  archaeological archive which includes the original excavation
                  records for Knossos. It contains over 50 notebooks kept by
                  Evans and other members of his team, hundreds of drawings of
                  architecture and finds, and thousands of photos. Some of the
                  drawings of frescoes were made by Émile Gilliéron, father and
                  son, as they tried to reconstruct the colourful fragments into
                  complete designs. Evans drew upon all of these as he wrote up
                  his excavations at Knossos in the massive four-volume work,
                  The Palace of Minos, published between 1921 and 1935.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-intro-fn4" id="page-intro-fnref4" class="footnote-ref-anchor">4</a></sup>
                  The archive also includes early drafts and proofs of this
                  book, and other publications by Evans. But the photos also
                  provide a glimpse of life during excavation, including the
                  many Cretan workers employed to work at Knossos and the
                  excavators themselves posing for the camera.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Fragile archive items cannot be put on long-term display in
                  the permanent gallery for reasons of conservation, but many of
                  the objects in the collection are already available on the
                  Ashmolean’s website, and as database records are checked, more
                  are being added all the time.

                <h2>The Labyrinth in myth and history</h2>
                <p>
                  In Greek myth the Minotaur was a monster with the head of a
                  bull and the body of a man who was imprisoned in a dark
                  underground Labyrinth at Knossos. The Labyrinth was an
                  ingenious maze commissioned by King Minos and designed by the
                  architect Daedalus. In order to escape it after killing the
                  Minotaur, Theseus needed a ball of thread, given to him by the
                  princess Ariadne. Or at least that is the most commonly
                  accepted story – digging deeper into the myth shows that
                  reveals a multitude of contradictory versions. Myths are
                  continually reworked and retold, and that of the Labyrinth is
                  no exception.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-essay-fn1" id="page-essay-fnref1" class="footnote-ref-anchor">1</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  Knossos, on the island of Crete, is mentioned in the earliest
                  work of Greek literature, Homer’s Iliad, which was composed
                  some time before 700 BCE. Intriguingly Homer tells us that
                  Daedalus built a dancing floor for Ariadne at Knossos, but
                  doesn’t mention the Labyrinth. Herodotus, the earliest Greek
                  historian, describes an impressive building called a
                  Labyrinth, but locates it in Egypt, at a city called
                  Crocodilopolis. Only later did authors locate the Labyrinth at
                  Knossos. Writing several hundred years later, the Roman
                  historian Pliny the Elder lists a number of different
                  Labyrinths, suggesting that the Egyptian building had inspired
                  Daedalus to build the one in Crete. But of this Cretan
                  Labyrinth, Pliny says, nothing remained.
                </p>
                <p>
                  At the same time as these different accounts of the Labyrinth
                  were being written down, artists were producing a variety of
                  depictions of the myth. Greek vases frequently show
                  <a href="#page-la-quire-catalogue-2">Theseus killing the Minotaur with a sword</a>. The
                  <a href="#page-la-quire-catalogue-1">coins of Knossos</a> were
                  decorated with a symbol of the city: a Labyrinth design which
                  sometimes had a Minotaur at the centre. This design, unlike
                  most literary descriptions, has a single path into the centre.
                  It appears more like a bird’s eye view of a building, and one
                  in which it is impossible to get lost.
                </p>
                <p>
                  <a href="#page-https-pleiades-stoa-org-places-589872" target="_blank">Knossos</a>
                  was an important Cretan city in the Greek and Roman period.
                  When the Roman conquest of Crete began in 69 BCE, its citizens
                  resisted. As a result the rival city of
                  <a href="#page-https-pleiades-stoa-org-places-589796" target="_blank">Gortyn</a>, 60 km south of Knossos, became the Roman provincial
                  capital. New civic buildings were required, and the stone for
                  these was quarried out of a nearby hillside. This left a
                  network of underground passages going deep underground. From
                  this period onwards, authors start to confuse Knossos and
                  Gortyn, and the location of the Labyrinth started to shift:
                  the Roman poet, Catullus for instance, refers to the home of
                  King Minos as ‘Gortynian’. A later Byzantine author, Ioannes
                  Malalas, described the Labyrinth as a cave near Gortyn.
                </p>
                <h2>Looking for the Labyrinth</h2>
                <p>
                  The Renaissance renewed interest in Greece and its myths,
                  resulting in a search for the real Labyrinth. The Florentine
                  priest, Cristoforo Buondelmonti, first visited Crete in 1415
                  and explored both Knossos and Gortyn. By this time there was
                  little to see at Knossos – it had been abandoned following an
                  earthquake in the 8th century CE – and certainly nothing that
                  resembled the Labyrinth. Buondelmonti described the
                  underground passages near Gortyn, and although he recognised
                  it as a quarry,
                  <a href="#page-https-digital-bodleian-ox-ac-uk-objects-ef292757-e16f-4818-ae90-f2cbbf9dc5b6-surfaces-5db6a6bd-6c61-4fe7-ba9e-8ca66c344009" target="_blank">his map of the island</a>
                  shows the Labyrinth as a cave in the middle of the island.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The debate over the location of the true Labyrinth continued
                  for several hundred years. In the 19th century Captain Thomas
                  Spratt visited the caves at Gortyn while surveying Crete for a
                  new map of the island for the British Admiralty. He described
                  them as “unquestionably a real labyrinth, such as the ancients
                  understood by that term” and wondered if King Minos had kept
                  Athenians prisoners there.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-essay-fn2" id="page-essay-fnref2" class="footnote-ref-anchor">2</a></sup>
                  Robert Pashley meanwhile regarded the Labyrinth as “a work of
                  the imagination” but kept faith with Knossos, despite the fact
                  that it had “dwindled down into this miserable hamlet”.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-essay-fn3" id="page-essay-fnref3" class="footnote-ref-anchor">3</a></sup>
                  The location of Knossos had never been forgotten since coins
                  of the city continued to be found there. The problem was that
                  there was nothing to see there for those going in search of
                  the Labyrinth.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The argument was finally resolved in 1878 by a local
                  businessman named, appropriately enough,
                  <a href="#page-https-en-wikipedia-org-wiki-minos-kalokairinos" target="_blank">Minos Kalokairinos</a>. He had been inspired to dig at Knossos by the excavations
                  of Heinrich Schliemann at Troy and Mycenae. There Schliemann
                  had found archaeological treasures which seemed to link these
                  places with their mythical past. Digging on an area to the
                  south of the Greek and Roman city, on the bare Kephala hill,
                  Kalokairinos soon found the remains of a building with curious
                  symbols carved on the walls. Given its apparent age, he
                  regarded this as the palace of King Minos, but located the
                  Labyrinth in a nearby cave at Ayia Irini. This too was an
                  ancient quarry, and shows Kalokairinos’s faith in the later
                  literary traditions.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Kalokairinos’s discovery rapidly attracted the attention of
                  foreign archaeologists. They agreed that the building looked
                  ancient but went a step further than Kalokairinos and
                  identified it with the Labyrinth. William Stillman sent a
                  report to the Archaeological Institute of America describing
                  the building with its complicated corridors as the “Daedalian
                  Labyrinth”.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-essay-fn4" id="page-essay-fnref4" class="footnote-ref-anchor">4</a></sup>
                  Kalokairinos had been forced to stop his excavations by the
                  Cretan authorities because at that time Crete was part of the
                  Ottoman Empire and it was feared that his finds would be
                  removed to the museum at Constantinople.
                </p>
                <h2>Excavating the Labyrinth</h2>
                <p>
                  When Arthur Evans visited Knossos in March 1894, he was shown
                  round the excavations by Kalokairinos and wrote in his diary
                  “I see no reason for not thinking that the mysterious
                  complication of passages is the Labyrinth”.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-essay-fn5" id="page-essay-fnref5" class="footnote-ref-anchor">5</a></sup>
                  He was fascinated by the symbols carved on the walls,
                  including a sign in the shape of a double axe. By purchasing a
                  part of the land and waiting until Cretan Independence, Evans
                  was able to establish the rights to excavate.

                <p>
                  Evans uncovered the rest of the labyrinthine building he
                  called ‘the Palace of Minos’ between 1900 and 1904. A number
                  of discoveries convinced him that this was indeed the
                  Labyrinth including
                  <a href="#page-la-quire-catalogue-4">frescoes of people leaping over bulls</a>
                  which echoed the myth of the Minotaur. He found further
                  carvings of double axes and suggested that since an ancient
                  name for this symbol was ‘labrys’, Labyrinth should mean
                  ‘House of the Double Axes’. In other words the Palace and the
                  Labyrinth were one and the same.
                </p>
                <h2>Rebuilding the Labyrinth</h2>
                <p>
                  Almost immediately, Evans set about restoring, and then
                  rebuilding, this Bronze Age building, now thought to have
                  existed from 2000–1350 BC. Some of the later ‘reconstitutions’
                  as he called them, used reinforced concrete to promote his
                  theories. The reconstructed bull fresco at the North Entrance,
                  he suggested, had continued to stand even after the Palace had
                  been destroyed, inspiring the myth of the Minotaur and the
                  Labyrinth.

                <h2>The Palace of Minos</h2>
                <p>
                  Between 1900 and 1905, Evans uncovered the remains of the huge
                  complex which he felt must be the palace of King Minos, and he
                  adopted the name ‘Minoans’ for its occupants. He employed a
                  team of archaeologists, local workers, architects and artists,
                  and together they built up a picture of the community that had
                  occupied the elaborate building 4000 years ago. The Palace of
                  Minos, as he called it, had evidently gone through periods of
                  wealth, destruction, rebuilding, and eventual abandonment.
                </p>
                <p>
                  It is now difficult to disentangle Evans’s vision of the
                  palace from the reality. Soon after excavation began in 1900,
                  a room with a stone seat came to light. Evans regarded this as
                  the throne of King Minos (although he originally wondered if
                  it was meant for princess Ariadne). The ‘Throne Room’ was
                  first reconstructed on paper and then physically. It is now is
                  one of the most famous parts of the Palace.

                <h2>Minoan Life: Eating and Drinking</h2>
                <p>
                  Elaborate tableware and colourful frescoes are evidence of the
                  Palace’s wealth, at least at its height. It was a place for
                  gatherings and celebrations. Wine, meat and olive oil were
                  produced in the surrounding area and brought to the centre for
                  consumption. Evans and his team imagined a sophisticated,
                  nature-loving people, whose civilisation peaked, and then went
                  into decline. Evans suggested that the finest pottery was used
                  by a royal family, but there is no clear evidence that one
                  existed.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The finest pottery was known as
                  <a href="#page-la-quire-catalogue-7">‘Kamares Ware’</a> since the
                  first examples were discovered in nearby Kamares Cave. It was
                  produced in the centuries after the palace was first built,
                  around 2000-1700 BCE. The black shiny finish and thin walls
                  seem to imitate silver, which goes black over time. Later on
                  pottery designs were painted directly on to the surface of the
                  clay. Some of these designs were abstract but others show
                  <a href="#page-la-quire-catalogue-8">plants</a> or marine animals.
                </p>
                <h2>The Status of Women</h2>
                <p>
                  Women appear prominently on frescoes and
                  <a href="#page-la-quire-catalogue-5">other objects</a> from the
                  Palace. They often wear elaborate dyed textiles indicating
                  wealth. Weaving and dyeing were important activities at
                  Knossos because these textiles were traded beyond the island
                  of Crete in return for raw materials like metals. It is
                  possible that these high-status women were important players
                  in the manufacture and trade in textiles. Some archaeologists
                  have even suggested that Minoan Crete was a matriarchy, with
                  women in power. Evans, however, believed that women’s
                  importance in Minoan society was religious, as priestesses of
                  a mother goddess.

                <p>
                  The Linear B tablets from Knossos were preserved by fire when
                  the palace was burnt down in around 1350 BCE. They record an
                  extensive textile industry in which men were
                  <a href="#page-la-quire-catalogue-9">shepherds</a> and women were
                  <a href="#page-la-quire-catalogue-10">textile workers</a>. By this
                  time there was a king, ‘wanax’ in charge of the palace but it
                  is not clear how far back this position goes because there are
                  no historical records preserved. When Linear B was deciphered
                  by Michael Ventris in 1952 it became apparent that all of the
                  tablets deal with the economy of the palace.
                </p>
                <h2>The Bulls of Crete</h2>
                <p>
                  Bulls crop up in several of the myths set in Crete and cattle
                  were closely associated with the Palace of Minos. They appear
                  on frescoes and
                  <a href="#page-la-quire-catalogue-3">seal-stones</a>, and there
                  were vessels in the shape of their
                  <a href="#page-la-quire-catalogue-12">heads</a>. Sometimes they
                  are shown with
                  <a href="#page-la-quire-catalogue-6">people leaping over their backs</a>. This appears to have been part of an event like a rodeo,
                  involving the cattle owned by the Palace. Some people have
                  suggested that this took place in the Central Court. Evans
                  proposed that bull-leaping inspired the myth of
                  <a href="#page-catalogue-2">Theseus and the Minotaur</a> because
                  the images were still visible even after the Palace was
                  destroyed.

                  Octopuses appear frequently – they almost become an emblem of
                  the Palace. One of the most<br>
                  unusual facts about them is that they are shown underwater,
                  their eyes open – as if being watched underwater, as opposed
                  to looked down on from above. Evans used depictions of marine
                  animals to trace what he saw as the birth, maturity and
                  decline of Minoan art. Although few would use these terms
                  today it is noticeable<br>
                  that earlier objects are more naturalistic. In the later
                  period of the Palace’s existence, the same designs – octopuses
                  and bulls feature frequently – become increasingly stylised.

                  One of the finest depictions of an octopus was carved in
                  relief on a stone vessel known as the ‘Ambushed Octopus’.
                  Designs like these were later transferred to pottery,
                  particularly
                  <a href="#page-la-quire-catalogue-11">large jars</a> found in the
                  storerooms of the palace. Even after the palace was destroyed,
                  tentacles were still used to decorate vessels.

                      Coins from Knossos, on the island of Crete, were decorated
                      with a symbol of the city: a labyrinth design which
                      sometimes had a Minotaur at the centre. The design on the
                      reverse of this coin, unlike most literary descriptions,
                      has a single path into the centre. It appears more like a
                      bird’s eye view of a building, and one in which it is
                      impossible to get lost.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      In Greek myth, the Minotaur was a monster with the head of
                      a bull and the body of a man who was imprisoned in a dark
                      underground labyrinth at Knossos. The Labyrinth was an
                      ingenious maze commissioned by King Minos and designed by
                      the architect Daedalus.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      In order to escape the maze after killing the Minotaur,
                      the hero Theseus needed a ball of thread, given to him by
                      the princess Ariadne. Or at least that is the most
                      commonly accepted story – digging deeper into the myth
                      reveals a multitude of contradictory versions. Myths are
                      continually reworked and retold, and that of the Labyrinth
                      is no exception.
                    </p>

                      in the same showcase also bears a labyrinth design. This
                      one is marked ΚΝΩΣΙ (KNOSI), short for ‘of the citizens of
                      Knossos’. It is evidence of the inhabitants of Knossos
                      using the Labyrinth as a symbol of their city.

                      On this red-figure cup we see Theseus lunge at the
                      Minotaur, grabbing him by the horn with his left hand and
                      attempting to stab him with the sword held in his right
                      hand.

                    <p>
                      In Greek myth, Theseus was the semi-divine hero who killed
                      the Minotaur, a monster with the head of a bull and the
                      body of a man confined in a Labyrinth on the island of
                      Crete. The Labyrinth was an ingenious maze commissioned by
                      King Minos. Following his defeat, Theseus returned to
                      Greece, and became king and the founder of Athens.

                    <p>
                      The cup has been reassembled from a group of separate
                      fragments with added plaster, and so parts of the
                      decoration are modern.

                      This is one of a number of ‘minotaur’ seals collected by
                      Sir Arthur Evans on his travels around Crete. He suggested
                      that designs such as this, with the head of a bull and the
                      legs of a human, could have inspired later coins from
                      Knossos showing the Minotaur. It is now believed that the
                      image was an abbreviated depiction of bull-leaping which
                      was subsequently misinterpreted.

                      This original fresco fragment belonged to one of the
                      bull-leaping panels related to the ‘Taureador Fresco’. It
                      shows an acrobat who has successfully completed their
                      jump. Sir Arthur Evans believed that the white skin
                      indicated a female athlete, following a convention used in
                      Egyptian wall paintings. It is more likely that the skin
                      colour, along with the elaborate hairstyle, depicts
                      relative status – paler skin suggested less time spent
                      outside.

                      The famous Snake Goddesses from Knossos were found in many
                      fragments and reconstructed to create the forms known
                      today. Arthur Evans originally identified the figure with
                      her arms down, holding snakes, as the Goddess. The figure
                      with her arms raised was originally known as the ‘votary’.
                      A cat was found in the same deposit but it is unlikely to
                      have adorned the votary’s headdress, as here. These
                      plaster replicas are not authentic copies of an original,
                      but a modern reconstruction.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      The originals were found in an underfloor deposit in the
                      palace of Knossos, known as the ‘Temple Repositories’. Its
                      contents dated to around 1600 BCE. Many of the objects,
                      including the Snake Goddesses, were made of a glassy
                      material known as faience.

                          This gold ring shows a man leaping over a bull. The
                          paved floor indicates that this took place in or
                          around the Palace. The object in front of the bull is
                          probably a folded garment of cloth or leather but its
                          significance is not clear. 1450–1375 BCE, gold said to
                          be from Archanes.

                      Cattle were important animals in Bronze Age Crete. In the
                      absence of natural predators they were probably left to
                      roam around the island and then rounded up when needed.
                      Bull-leaping seems to have emerged from this way of
                      managing cattle, like the American rodeo. A gold ring like
                      this was used as a signet ring, to leave an impression in
                      clay documents as a form of signature. Perhaps its wearer
                      had distinguished themselves as a bull-leaper.

                      This cup, with its thin crinkled sides and shiny surface
                      was designed to imitate a metal vessel. The black slip and
                      white paint perhaps indicate a silver vessel which has
                      tarnished (turned black) after reacting with the oxygen in
                      the air.

                      Pottery of this kind was found in the Kamares Cave in
                      Crete in 1893 by a local shepherd and brought to the
                      museum at Heraklion. There it was seen by John Myres, an
                      archaeologist who had recently excavated similar pottery
                      in Egypt. Since Egyptian chronology was well known, this
                      meant that it could be dated to the early second
                      millennium BCE. When Arthur Evans began excavating at
                      Knossos in 1900, he was able to use ‘Kamares Ware’ as a
                      means to date the levels of the Palace in which this
                      pottery was found.

                      This cup is decorated with stylised flowers, which
                      resemble those of an olive tree. The paint has been
                      directly applied to the bare surface of the vessel before
                      firing resulting in a ‘dark-on-light’ design, which

                      reference number among all the tablets found at Knossos.
                      117 refers to the person who wrote it, identified by their
                      handwriting. OVIS is latin for sheep (labelled as both
                      male and female), which is a convention for transcribing
                      tablets. The syllables refer to the sounds of the Linear B
                      signs.

                      Standing at an impressive 75 centimetres, this
                      three-handled jar depicts an octopus with six tentacles
                      swimming in an abstract seascape. It was presented to the
                      Ashmolean in 1911 by the government of Crete through Sir
                      Arthur Evans, Keeper of the Ashmolean from 1884 to 1908.
                      The jar comes from the palace that Evans had excavated at
                      Knossos and belongs to a culture he called Minoan, after
                      the legendary King Minos.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      In the centuries after 1900 BC, Minoan civilization
                      reached the height of its prosperity and influence and
                      major palaces were built at Knossos and Mallia in the
                      northern part of Crete, at Phaistos in the south, and at
                      Zakros in the east. After 1500 BC, however, there was
                      increasing influence from the Mycenaean culture of the
                      Greek mainland and, around 1450 BC, widespread destruction
                      on the island. Whether this was caused by invading
                      Mycenaean warriors is unknown, but Greek influence on
                      Crete certainly becomes even more pronounced.

                      Pottery from the period following the destruction shows a
                      blend of Minoan and Mycenaean stylistic traits. The shape
                      of this jar is typically Mycenaean and, because the
                      contents of such vessels – oil, wine and other commodities
                      – were in much demand, examples have been found widely. An
                      octopus had been a popular motif on Minoan pottery where
                      animals were depicted with an extraordinary accuracy that
                      came from a close observation of nature. The Mycenaean
                      approach, however, was – as here – to take naturalistic
                      motifs and abstract them, eventually to the point at which
                      they are almost unrecognisable. The
                      <a href="#page-https-collections-ashmolean-org-object-478546" target="_blank">stirrup jar</a>
                      below, also in the Aegean World gallery, shows how the
                      octopus has become reduced to a wavy tentacle design.

                      Rhyta are pouring vessels. The object which this is a
                      replica of would have been filled with wine, which would

                      The bull’s head rhyton discovered during the excavation of
                      the Little Palace at Knossos has become one of the most
                      famous objects found at Knossos on the island of Crete.
                      Archaeologist Sir Arthur Evans, the excavator of Knossos,
                      was not allowed to remove the original from Crete and so
                      commissioned this plaster replica. It was included in an
                      exhibition at the Royal Academy in 1936 where replicas
                      stood in for objects which remained in Cretan museums.

                  The exhibition
                  <em>Labyrinth: Knossos, Myth &amp; Reality</em> was held at
                  the Ashmolean Museum in 2023. Content from this exhibition was
                  reused in this publication: ‘The Aegean World Gallery: The
                  Cretan collection’ is from the exhibition catalogue; ‘Looking
                  for the Labyrinth: From Myth to Reality’ is from the Ashmolean
                  website; ‘Life in the Palace: Knossos in the Bronze Age’ is
                  from the exhibition panel text; the catalogued objects were
                  with one exception (Kamares Cup) in the exhibition and
                  catalogue text has been adapted from exhibition labels and
                  object records.
